# Data Uploader utility

## Upload memory data to the Apple 1 Mini

It's difficult to upload data to the Apple 1 Mini using most standard terminal clients because there need to be specific delays in between data being sent.  
This utility simplifies that process by letting select a file and handling the upload for you.  

**Utility is still under development and not very user friendly at the moment!**
