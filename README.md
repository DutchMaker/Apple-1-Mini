# Apple 1 Replica build

This is my take on an Apple 1 replica.  
[The schematic](https://github.com/DutchMaker/Apple-1-Replica/blob/master/design/DesignSpark/schematic%20-%20Schematic.pdf) is based on learnings I took from the Briel Computers Apple Replica 1.  
Also lot's of lessons were learned and resources taken from The Ben Heck Show: https://github.com/thebenheckshow/158-tbhs-apple-1-replica

*This build is currently in progress*

The current state is that the board is working and only supports serial connection through the Arduino.  
The board itself is still in its first revision and is going to be significantly shrinked for the next revision.  
I am planning to release revision 1 as a kit that supports expansion cards for future development.
